# Snowboarding Game
This is my snowboarding game! This code was written as part of an Instructor Guided Course on Udemy. This game was made using C#.

The objective of the game is to snowboard on a hill and avoid rocks as well as trying to not fall on your head! It also includes a finish line and audio for when you fail and or complete the map.
